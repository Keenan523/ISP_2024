This is a repository representing my project to create a machine learning model predicting energy production and consumption of prosumers in Estonia using a variety of related data. This was a challenge issued by Eesti Energy through Kaggle. 

The repository contains:

A summary document of the project(Enefit Energy Solar Data Analysis.docx)

Three R Rmd files and their corresponding html files:

- Data_Exploration: a file containing graphs and data visualizations created as part of the data exploration process
- DataMerge_MLmodel1: a file containing the merger process for merge version 1, as well as some corresponding machine learning model training and results
- DataMerge_MLmodel2: a file containing the merger process for merge version 2, as well as some corresponding machine learning model training and results

A ipynb file containing model fitting in python. Includes the most successful of the fitted models, a log transformed random forest model using merged data version 2.
